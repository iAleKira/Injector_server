	 *         variables that will contain a capture group, the first, and an
	 *         eventual capture group inside the first one. In case there is a
	 *         nested capture group, it merges them at line 41 and deletes them at line 42.
	 *         This is because it will parse it later. It then replaces the capture group with the input payload,
	 *         if the payload matches the capture group, otherwise it uses the parser in {@link Server} class. 
	 *         It then deletes the capture group from the backup string. When there are no
	 *         more capture groups left the cycle stops.
	 *         If there is no match, then the string gets deleted, as this is useful for All_payloads_filter.
