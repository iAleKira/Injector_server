/**
 * @author Alessandro Bonfiglio.
 * 
 *         This class is All_payloads_filter.jar main class. It filters an
 *         inputFile line by line, into an outputFile by a certain payload. User
 *         can check whether a file can be injected with a payload of choice or
 *         not.
 * 
 *         Number of input arguments. 0: uses default settings. 3: uses user
 *         input files.
 * 
 *         It then implements the filtering algorithm. An ExploitBuilder is
 *         needed, therefore it uses ExploitBuilder.jar library. The input file
 *         is read line by line, and for each line the filter checks if it can be
 *         filtered, according to the implementation, by the method
 *         {@link canBeFiltered}. If the return value is true, we then proceed
 *         restricting the string in between pipes symbols | | and then inject
 *         it with the ExploitBuilder. If the injection succeeds, then the
 *         original string from the file is saved in the output file. If the
 *         injection fails, therefore the resulting string is empty, we discard
 *         it.
 * 
 * @throws IOException: All_payloads_filter.jar, as default, is meant to be
 *                      launched from a fixed directory together with the file
 *                      it filters. - If the file is not found in the same
 *                      directory as Filter.jar: a FileNotFoundException is
 *                      triggered and the executable exits with error: "File
 *                      top-services-probes.txt not found. File needs to be
 *                      included...". - If the input file, default:
 *                      top-services-probes.txt, is found in the same directory
 *                      as Filter.jar but there is no output file then a
 *                      FileNotFoundException is triggered and the executable
 *                      exits with error: "Output path needs to exist..".
